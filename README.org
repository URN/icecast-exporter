#+TITLE: Icecast Exporter

Icecast Exporter exports statistics from Icecast into Prometheus.

We use this at [[https://urn1350.net/][University Radio Nottingham]] for pulling statistics from our web streaming into a Grafana instance which is used to find listener counts in time-series.

** Usage

Once you have a binary, you can use the program with the following command line flags:

| Flag       | Default    | Required | Description                                                     |
|------------+------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~url~      | N/A        | ✅       | The URL of the Icecast ~status-json.xsl~ endpoint to poll from. |
| ~port~     | 2112       | ❌       | The port to listen and serve metrics from.                      |
| ~endpoint~ | ~/metrics~ | ❌       | Endpoint to serve metrics from.                                 |
| ~interval~ | ~15~       | ❌       | Timing interval to poll Icecast (seconds).                      |

An example invocation is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./icecast-exporter -url https://icecast.example.com/status-json.xsl -port 1234
#+END_SRC
